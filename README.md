# Matching Columns game built using Lightning Web Components

Matching Columns is a game where you'll have to match an item in one column with its pair in the second column. I've used [Lightning Web Components](https://lwc.dev) to build a version of this game, which you can play using the link below.

## How to play?

1. Navigate to [this Heroku App](https://matching-columns-lwc.herokuapp.com/).
1. Click on any of the themes
1. Drag the tiles in the second column up and down to reorder them.
1. Click on **Done, verify my answers** button once you think you have paired both columns correctly.
