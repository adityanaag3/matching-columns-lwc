# Matching Columns game built using Lightning Web Components

Matching Columns is a game where you'll have to match an item in one column with its pair in the second column. I've used [Lightning Web Components](https://lwc.dev) to build a version of this game, which you can play using the link below.

## How to play?

1. Navigate to [this Heroku App](https://matching-columns-lwc.herokuapp.com/).
1. Use any of the following game codes
    1. `df`: Match the celebrity speaker to the Dreamforce year
    3. `products`: Match the product's original name to its current rebranded name
    4. `thr`: Match the Trailhead Rank with the minimum number of badges needed to achieve it
    5. `limits`: Match the governor limit description with its corresponding number
    6. `superbadges`: Match the superbadge with the number of points gained by completing it
    7. `sfdx`: Match the parameter names of the force:source:deploy command with it's purpose
3. Drag the tiles in the second column up and down to reorder them.
4. Click on **Done, verify my answers** button once you think you have paired both columns correctly.
